# Rate-a-Movie API Project

This project was part of a group assignment for CSE 341, where we were asked to build an API for a particular product or service.

Our group decided to build a movie review platform that manages the reviews of movies and links reviews to users. We implemented several routes, including actors, movies, reviews, and users.

We used Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose to build this project.
